## Project Description

### Understanding Dialysis:
- Dialysis is a crucial medical treatment designed to replicate some functions of the kidneys when they are no longer able to work effectively. It is primarily used for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
  or severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). Dialysis helps maintain the balance of the body's systems by removing waste products, excess fluids, and maintaining electrolyte levels.
- The kidneys play a vital role in filtering blood, removing waste products, and balancing fluids and electrolytes. When the kidneys fail to perform these functions, dialysis becomes essential to sustain life and 
  health.

### Health Care Overview:
- The Health Care Dialysis industry is a complex sector that operates globally, encompassing various treatment methods including hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. It is a dynamic industry influenced by various 
 factors, requiring adaptability, strategic planning, and a commitment to patient safety and satisfaction for long-term success.
- Analyzing data in the dialysis industry is fundamental for improving efficiency and making informed decisions. Data is analyzed using relational, graphical, and document data models with tools like Excel, 
  Tableau, Power BI, and SQL.

## Insights

1. Number of Patients across various summaries

- This KPI provides insights into the demand for dialysis services and assists healthcare providers in delivering personalized care.

- It emphasizes the importance of prioritizing resources and interventions based on the frequency and health impact of each summary type.

2. Profit Vs Non-Profit Stats

- Comparing the financial performance is an important aspect which is required to understand the economic landscape of the health care sector.
- This analysis helps in identifying the differences in financial outcomes between profit and non-profit organizations and enables the stakeholders to take informed decisions regarding resource allocation, cost 
  management and sustainability of care.

3. Chain Organizations w.r.t. Total Performance Score as No Score

- Assessment of Chain Performance: This KPI measures the performance of various chain organizations (e.g., dialysis centers) by tracking how many of them have a "No Score" status for their Total Performance 
  Score, indicating that these organizations either haven’t been evaluated or their performance data is missing.

- Identifying Gaps: It helps in identifying gaps in performance data collection and evaluation. A high number of "No Score" entries may signal issues in reporting, data collection, or performance assessment 
  processes within the chain organizations.

4. Dialysis Stations Stats
- The number of Dialysis Stations varies across Countries, States and Cities.
- Country-wise, the highest number of dialysis stations is located in Los Angeles (4,129) followed by Harris (2,499) and Cook (2,365).
- State-wise, the highest number of dialysis stations is located in California (15,095) folowed by Texas (14,200) and Florida (8,838).
- City-wise, the highest numberof dialysis stations is located in Houston (1,972) followed by Chicago (1,329) and San Antonio (1,165).
- This variation is likely due to number of factors, including population density, the prevalance of Kidney disease, and the availability of healthcare resources.

5. #of Category Text  - As Expected
- Patient Hospitalization Category tops the highestnumber of "As Expected" results (6,818) followed by Patient Hospital Re-admission Category text (6,714) and PPPW Category text (6,659).
- This suggests that these category must be well understood or predictable in terms of outcomes.

6. Average Payment Reduction Rate
- Average Payment Reduction rate calculates and tracks the average rate at which payments are reduced, providing insights to cost-saving measures.
- The analysis of this KPI helps the healthcare providers in assessing the financial performance, identifying the factors cnotributing to payment reduction.

## Conclusion

The "Dialysis of Patients" project analyzes data from two datasets with over 7,000 records each, revealing key insights into dialysis services. The total number of patients across various summaries is 22.32 million, with the "Serum Phosphorous Summary" having the highest patient count. There are 369 chain organizations with a total performance score of "No Score." The total number of dialysis stations is 135,000, with Los Angeles leading among cities, California among states, and the U.S. overall achieving an 89% profit rate, with Los Angeles contributing the most. All these findings are displayed in a comprehensive dashboard created in Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, with each KPI featured in its own subdashboard for detailed analysis, helping to make informed decisions and gain a deeper understanding of dialysis services performance.
